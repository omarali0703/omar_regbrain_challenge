        "# Omar Ali's Cube Submission\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction ⚓\n",
        "> I have chosen to go with the route of pre-parsing text for analysis using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). RST is a theory within text analysis I worked very closely with, that allows you to abstract text in a hierarchical fashion. This is done using a three stage process (Segmenting, Relationship generation and Tree generation). For the consideration of time, a well known RST parser (HILDA) will be used to carry our these stages. As the parser's implementation is fairly old, It has been contained by a wrapper using Docker. Therefore, I will preparse the text I will use in this work and output the findings into a folder for use in this Notebook. Streamlining this process will be explored at the end of this submission with further-work and improvements also explained.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goal ⭐\n",
        "> Overall, the main goal of my submission is to understand the language and structure that goes into Policy-definining documents. I will do so by creating a subset of the data for use in RST parsing. This will allow me to weight them and take the most important for use in training a transformer for binary classification. *Less important information taken from the dataset (Not related to policy enforcing) will be used as the second class.*\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview of Implementation 🕵\n",
        "\n",
        "> For the consideration of time, I have pre-generated RST trees from a selection of instances within the provided dataset. In practice this would be scaled up to an automated generation cycle per instance whereby, for each instance added to the database, and RST tree would be generated.\n",
        "> \n",
        "> For each instance, the RST tree would be weighted with the most important parts considered highly above the less important sections. Following a similar model to text summarisation, the least important aspects will be removed.\n",
        "> \n",
        "> With the most important parts identified we can train a model to determine what features are present within topics that are indicative of emerging changes required by policymakers. This model allows for our analysis to be scaled to different instances that are coming through every day. \n",
        "> \n",
        "> The hypothesis is that there is some level of consistency within information indicative of a policy change. I hope that the added level of rhetorical structure theory and its segmentation will allow for these parts to be highlighted and learned from.\n",
        "> \n",
        "> In future, I may also consider using the relationships between spans of text as an indication to emerging policies. For example relationships that represent attributions or cause-and-effect might likely be an indication of emerging changes to policy.\n",
